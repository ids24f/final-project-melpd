# Background

## Data Science Jobs

- As the collection of data becomes more important across a variety of industries,
the need for trained data scientists as increased. 
- According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there has been a 36% growth in 
data science jobs (compared to the average job growth of 4%).
- What does it take to get a data science related job?
- What are the skills that are valued in these positions?

# Research Question

## What skills are important for different data science jobs?

- What are the most important skills for a job as a data scientist?
- What are the most important skills for a job as a data analyst?
- What are the most important skills for a job as a machine learning engineer?
- What are the most important skills for a job as a data engineer?

# Data

## Data

- The dataset consists of 660 job postings related to data science
- The data set was collected from Kaggle
- The following is the summary of the job titles:
  - data scientist    447
  - other              68
  - analyst            55
  - data engineer      46
  - mle                34

## Feature Engineering

- To answer the research question, feature engineering:  
  - Identified prevalent skills in the job descriptions.  
  - Created **boolean columns** indicating whether a skill was mentioned.  
- The identified skills include:  
  - **Programming Skills**: Python, SQL, Java, C++, Scala, R  
  - **Big Data Tools**: Hadoop, Spark, AWS, Git, Linux, Azure  
  - **Visualization Tools**: Tableau, Matlab  
  - **Soft Skills**: Communication, leadership, collaboration, problem-solving, critical thinking  

# Methods

## Random Forests

- A **Random Forest classifier** was used to analyze the data.  
- To handle class imbalance, I used class weights within the model.
- The model evaluated the presence of skills against job titles.
- From the random forest, feature importance can identify the most important skills that predicted the job type
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values: measure the impact of each feature on the model's predictions.
  - Gini Importance: consideres the overall reduction in impurity caused by each feature

# Results

## Most Frequently Referenced Skills

- The word **team** appeared in 568 job postings 
- **Python** is referenced in 482 job postings
- **SQL** is referenced in 352 job postings
- The word **communication** appears in 325 job postings
- **Excel** is referenced in 291 job postings

# Evaluating the Model

Overall, the model achieved an accuracy of 76.9%.

## Summary of the Classification Report

- Analyst: Precision and recall were both low (precision: 0.71, recall: 0.38).
- Data Engineer: Precision was good (0.80), but recall was poor (0.36), suggesting the model was selective but missed many true instances of this class.
- Data Scientist: This was the best-performing class, with high precision (0.79), recall (0.92), and F1-score (0.85). 
- MLE: Performance was moderate, with a precision of 0.75 and a recall of 0.43, leading to an F1-score of 0.55.
- Other: The model performed equally in precision and recall (0.60 for both), with a balanced F1-score of 0.60.

# Discussion

## Possible Limitations

- The data set on Kaggle is listed at about 4 years old, which may make the data
not as relevant to today's job market
- I used a very naive approach to the feature engineering so 
certain features may have been missed.
- Due to the heavy imbalance in the dataset, it was hard to improve the model
for more accurate results.

## What did we learn?

- While there is a lot of overlap between different types of data science jobs,
there is also certain skills that make each unique
- **Python**, **SQL**, **Communication** are important for all of the jobs
- Certain soft skills are more valuable to certain jobs (for example, data scientists
 and collaboration, analysts and teamwork, data engineers and problem-solving, 
 machine learning and leadership)
