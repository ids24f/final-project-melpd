# Background

## Data Science Jobs

- As the collection of data becomes more important across a variety of industries,
the need for trained data scientists as increased. 
- According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there has been a 36% growth in 
data science jobs (compared to the average job growth of 4%).
- What does it take to get a data science related job?
- What are the skills that are valued in these positions?

# Research Question

## What skills are important for different data science jobs?

- What are the most important skills for a job as a data scientist?
- What are the most important skills for a job as a data analyst?
- What are the most important skills for a job as a machine learning engineer?
- What are the most important skills for a job as a data engineer?

# Data

## Data

- The dataset consists of job postings related to data science
- The data set was collected from Kaggle
- There are 660 postings in total
- Some relevant columns are the job description and the job title

## Feature Engineering

- In order to answer the research question, some feature engineering needs to be 
done to identify the skills needed within the job posting
- I identified prevalent skills (both technical and soft skills) and created boolean 
columns so that if the skill was mentioned in the job description, a 1 would be put 
in that skills column
- The skills identifies where 'python','excel', 'hadoop', 'spark', 'aws', 'tableau', 'big_data',
communication', 'leadership', 'collaborate', 'team', 'adapt', 'problem solving', 'critical thinking',
'SQL', 'Java', 'C\+\+', 'Scala', 'SAS', 'Git', 'Linux', 'Matlab', 'Azure', and ' R,'
