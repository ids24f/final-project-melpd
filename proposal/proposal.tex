\paragraph{Introduction}
Background about your research; touch the three questions to be addressed in an
introduction; cite relevant refernces~\citep[e.g.,][]{dwivedi2017analysis}.

As a senior in college, it is only natural that I have been considering what my career will look like post-graduation.
As a result, I have been looking at job applications to see what employers are looking for in candidates and if I qualify. 
It is very easy to get overwhelmed by all the skills and qualifications that you need to have in order to get the job that 
you want. In this project, Iâ€™ll explore the different types of data science roles by clustering job postings based on skill 
requirements and job types.

\paragraph{Specific Aims}
Formulate your research question;
translate your research question into statistical/data science questions

The goal of this project is to identify what factors employers are looking for in a candidate for a data science job.

\paragraph{Data}
The data set I will be using is based on job postings on Glassdoor. The data can be found on Kaggle.

\paragraph{Research Design and Methods}
What design or methods will you use?
Cite relevant references~\citep[e.g.,][]{wild2004global}.

To perform my analysis, I will be apply a clustering algorithm such as K-means or Hierarchical Clustering. 

\paragraph{Discussion}
What are the most challenge parts of the task?
What are the limitations of your work? What is your fall-back plan if
something unexpected happens?
